# Sari Sari Store Analytics
The dashboard presents the performance of a fictional _sari-sari store_, a small convenience shop in the Philippines. It helps the business owner understand customer patterns to make inform decisions on inventory and daily operations.

## Problem Statement
A fictional sari-sari store owner requires clear insight that directly impact profitability and sustainability. The owner wants to know how much revenue the store generates over time, which products and categories drive or hinder performance, whether stockouts are causing lost sales, which items are overstocked and tying up limited capital, how sales fluctuate across days and time periods, when peak sales occur, and which products should be prioritized for restocking. Without clear answers to these questions, the store owner is unable to make informed, data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, maximize sales opportunities, and improve overall business performance.

## Data Source
Using a modified dataset from Kaggle, data showcasing costs, purchased goods, payment methods used, and time of purchase were analyzed.
